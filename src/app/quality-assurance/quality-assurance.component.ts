        After a careful consideration of various Higher Education Quality Assurance models from around the world, we developed an integrated model for QA, Risk and planning. Our software solution for QA is based on that model and is revolutionary as it does not only integrates ideas from higher education research but also weaves in key elements of higher education which have strong influence on quality of teaching and learning environment, processes and intended outcomes. The model keep learners at its centre and emphasizes responsibility and accountability of staff and faculty towards students who are the key customers.`,
